Welcome to my Dungeons and Dragons Database. Recently I sold some old comic books to a local comic and game shop. Due to the current economic situation caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, the shop could only offer store credit. Because I am looking to get back into Dungeons and Dragons (5<sup>th</sup> Edition), I was okay with this arrangement. The local shop charges cover price, but Amazon sells the same products cheaper. To refresh my SQL skills, I am going to create multiple data sets and use queries to determine how to maximize my store credit.
