Welcome to my Dungeons and Dragons Database. Recently I sold some old comic books to a local comic and game shop. Due to the current economic situation caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, the shop could only offer store credit. Because I am looking to get back into Dungeons and Dragons (5<sup>th</sup> Edition), I was okay with this arrangement. The local shop charges cover price, but Amazon sells the same products cheaper. To refresh my SQL skills, I am going to create multiple data sets and use queries to determine how to maximize my store credit.

4/4/2020 At this point, I have created a database in SQLite and imported my 3 tables and wrote a basic query to list the 14 out of the 16 products. I excluded the two kits because I am not sure I need the kits after I purchase the other products.
